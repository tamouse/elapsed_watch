module ElapsedWatch
  VERSION = "0.0.1"

  DESCRIPTION = "
Reading a file of events, containing an event name (a string) and a
date-time string (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm(:ss)), print a nice duration since
the event (if the event occurs in the past) or until the event (if the
event occurs in the future).

The impetous for this little program is my wanting to know how long it
has been since my last cigarette.
